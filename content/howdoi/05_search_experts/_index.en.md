This tile is most useful for identifying specific experts a team leader needs to work on an opportunity. 

Team experts can be searched for in three ways:

To find a specific team expert, type their name into the search bar at the top of the screen, or click on the microphone in the right corner of the search box to enable speech to text. 

After typing out a name, hit ENTER or the blue SEARCH button to the right of the search box to process results.

Further, the table headings can be arranged into ascending or descending order. Click on the heading and a small arrow will appear indicating the list is ordered and in what direction.

Additional filtering options are provided at the top of the screen. Click on a filter option to expand the filter and select the item/s you wish to filter by.
