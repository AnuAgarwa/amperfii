* Amperfii will review the information from the first two screens and automatically identify Opportunities that are either duplicates or very similar.  

* By clicking on the Opportunity name you can perform a high level review of the Opportunity and add comments below if the Opportunity is relevant to your request.  

* This information will then be used by the data science team to ensure they are consolidating and/or reusing existing Opportunities to ensure the most optimum outcome.
