Amperfii allows you to receive feedback from Sponsors and Peers relating to the Opportunity you are proposing.  This is critical element to ensure the data science team can scope the Opportunity accurately.

Click on the ADD REVIEWER button and select whether the reviewer will be a Sponsor or Peer.  Once selected you will be required to enter their email address and then click on SEND NOTIFICATION.

Amperfii will send a notification to your proposer and/or peer with instructions as to how to provide their comments.  Those comments will then be list both on this screen and also in the Opportunity summary.
