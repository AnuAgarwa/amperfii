The SEARCH tile allows you to search the knowledge repository.  The default view is always Opportunity which contains all previous and current opportunities relating to the business and is primarily used for ease of access in locating and reviewing the necessary opportunities.

However, you can do key word searches such as “Root Cause” which will identify relevant Opportunities.

![Table Filters](../../images/tile_search_input.png "Table Filters")

Filtering results using the search function can be done in two ways:

Opportunities can be ordered by clicking table headings and arranging in an ascending or descending order. 


![Filters Menu](../../images/tile_search_table_filters.png "Filters Menu")

Opportunities can also be filtered using the drop-down menu at the top of the page. Click on one of the headings to bring down additional filter options and select the options to filter by. Opportunities can be filtered by:

**Date submitted** – select a time frame in which you want to search within.

**State list** – select which state of review you want to search within

**Phase list** – select which process phase you want to search within

**Priority score** – select the level of priority you want to search within using a click and drag slider function

**Priority level** – select which sub-category (low, medium, high) of priority you want to search within

**Role** – select which business roles you want to search within

Within the table you can also click on the name of the Opportunity you wish to review and this will take you into the detailed Opportunity screen which we will discuss later.
