**Amperfii** Is a process-based advanced analytics methodology which manages the
life-cycle of an Opportunity.

#### Opportunity
An Opportunity can be; an idea, a project, a problem - that can lead to
improvements in a business outcome (i.e. improved processes, improved decisions,
etc)
#### Phases
The Amperfii methodology has six phases (see below for more details):
1. Capture: Captures the business idea or problem and the outcomes or decision
that will result by solving the problem
2. Shape: Shape the business problem, by defining its scope, size, resources
required, etc
3. Analyse: Performs the heavy-lifting in terms of the analysis work – goes through
a process of looking for a solution
4. Recommend: Reaches a conclusion and provides one or more options
5. Implement: Implements the preferred Option, and
6. Track: Tracks the performance of the implementation and realisation of the
business outcome.
The system also links two other key components in this process:
#### Resources
‘Resources’ are people who actually perform the work (your; Data Analysts,
your Business Analysts, etc) and this is done through the Experts module
#### Knowledge-Base
Knowledge-Base contains, Completed and In-Progress
Opportunities and facilitates; Re-use and avoids creating duplicates or similar
types of Opportunities.
